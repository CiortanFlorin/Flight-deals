This project uses SMS, flight news API, google sheets, and OOP to get these features:

-provided a list of tourist locations such as London or Bali and a minimum price you are ok with paying for each one of them via google sheets using Sheety API

-the script can get the airport code of these cities

-after that, it can look for the price of flights from your location to the destination and if there is any flight cheaper than the minimum price you asked for, it will send you an SMS with the dates of the flight and the price
